## Preface

Before you proceed, I would like to direct your attention to the
[credits](#credits) section below, where I pay tribute to the individuals who
have contributed to this project. Whether through code references, suggestions,
bug reports, or simply moral support, they have my most sincere gratitude.

## High Level Overview

This is a high level overview of this monorepo, containing configurations for
**all** of my machines that are currently running NixOS, or have ran NixOS at
some point in time. You will find below a list of my hosts and their
specifications, accompanied by a somewhat maintained list of features of this
configuration and my design considerations.

### Notable Features

[theme options]: modules/options/style
[profiles]: modules/core/profiles
[wallpkgs]: https://github.com/notashelf/wallpkgs
[flake-parts]: https://flake.parts
[impermanence]: https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence

- **Flakes enabled** - leans heavily into flake-exclusive features of Nix
- **All-in-one** - Servers, desktops, laptops, virtual machines and anything you
  can think of. Managed in one place.
  - **Sane Defaults** - The modules attempt to bring the most sane defaults,
    while providing per-host toggles for conflicting choices.
  - **Flexible Modules** - Both Home-manager and NixOS modules allow users to
    retrieve NixOS or home-manager configurations from anywhere.
  - **Extensive Configuration** - Most desktop programs are configured out of
    the box and shared across hosts, with override options for per-host
    controls.
  - **Custom extended library** - An extended library for functions that help
    organize my system.
- **Shared Configurations** - Reduces re-used boilerplate code by sharing
  modules and profiles across hosts.
- **Fully Modular** - Utilizes NixOS' module system to avoid hard-coding any of
  the options.
  - **Profiles & Roles** - Provide serialized configuration sets and pluggables
    for easily changing large portions of configurations with less options and
    minimal imports.
  - **Detached Homes** - Home-manager configurations are able to be detached for
    non-NixOS usage.
  - **Modularized Flake Design** - With the help of [flake-parts], the flake is
    fully modular: keeping my `flake.nix` cleaner than ever.
  - **Declarative Themes** - Using my [theme options], [profiles] and
    [wallpkgs]. Everything theming is handled inside the flake.
  - **Tree-wide formatting** - Format files in any language with the help of
    devshells and treefmt-nix modules for flake-parts.
- **Declarative nftables firewall** - Flexible and over-engineered[^1]
  `nftables` table/chain builder abstraction for easy firewall setups.
- **Personal Installation Media** - Personalized ISO images for system
  installation and recovery.
- **Secrets Management** - Manage secrets through Agenix.
- **Opt-in Impermanence** - On-demand ephemeral root using BTRFS rollbacks and
  [impermanence].
- **Encryption Ready** - Supports and actively utilizes full disk encryption.
- **Wayland First** - Leaves Xorg in the past where it belongs. Everything is
  configured around Wayland, with Xorg only as a fallback.
- **Custom Xanmod Kernel** with a wide variety of patches to strip unneeded
  modules, and to provide platform specific optimizations for my desktop.

### Rules/Design Considerations

Most of those rules, so to speak, are quite obvious. However they are noted down
as a favor to potential contributors, and to potential observers who wish to
make sense of certain decisions that are made.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore-start -->

[hosts directory]: hosts/README.md

> [!NOTE]
> Notes on host-specific design rules and considerations have been moved
> to the [hosts directory].

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore-end -->

- A commit should always be scoped/labeled. For example, while modifying a file
  in `hosts/enyo`, the commit would begin with `hosts/enyo:` followed by the
  description of the change.
- **alejandra** is the only Nix formatter that shall be used within this
  repository. nixfmt and nixpkgs-fmt both advertise ugly and confusing diffs,
  which I dislike. Some of Alejandra's quirks (e.g. lists) can be avoided with
  minor additions to the code.
- Backwards imports **should** be avoided wherever applicable.
- The repository should remain modular, and enabled options must **never**
  create inconsistencies or incompatibilities between hosts. In case of an
  unavoidable incompatibility, the issue must be documented. If possible,
  trigger conditions for incompatibilities must be avoided via assertions.
- Host-exclusive condition must **always** be placed in the host's own
  directory. Hosts **must** advertise their capabilities and features in
  `hosts/<hostname>/modules`
- `with lib;` **must** be avoided at all costs. Same goes for `with builtins;`
  which follows the same confusing pattern as `with lib;`. In some cases, `with`
  scopes may be accepted but only on the condition that the scope is narrow.
  - While accessing standard library functions, the call to library must be
    explicit. An example to this would be: `inherit (lib.modules) mkIf;` instead
    of repeating `lib.mkIf` or `lib.modules.mkIf` every time it is used.
  - `with pkgs;` _is_ fine, however its scope must be kept small. The biggest
    scope in which it shall be allowed is the smallest scope possible, e.g.,
    `environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ ];`. Anything larger than that
    should be avoided at all costs.

### Goals/Non-goals

#### Goals

I have a bunch of goals that I wish to accomplish by, and while working on this
repository. Those goals are:

- Provide _everything_ - we would like to provide modules, packages, system and
  home configurations all in one place
- Modularity - we would like to _never_ compromise on modularity, and two hosts
  of different purposes must _never_ conflict.
- Purity - `--impure` flag is a no-go.
- Documentation - anything that has been done should be documented. Best-effort
  not guaranteed.

#### Non-goals

- Full reproducibility - we contain secrets, therefore the setup is not fully
  reproducible.
- Compatibility - I do not intend to provide any kind of backwards compatibility
  for older Nix versions, or varying Nix forks.
- Replicability - this configuration does not aim to, and will not serve as a
  framework. I make no guarantees of replicability.
- Support - take a wild guess.
- Stability - see above.

## Credits & Special Thanks

[atrocious abstractions]: parts/lib/builders.nix

My most sincere thanks go to [@fufexan](https://github.com/fufexan) for
convincing me to use NixOS and sticking around to answer my most stupid and
deranged questions, as well as my [atrocious abstractions]. Without his help, I
would not be able to stand where I do.

I also wish to extend my thanks to [@sioodmy](https://github.com/sioodmy) which
my configuration was initially based on. Though layouts and files have since
changed, the core principals and ideas remain. The simplicity of his
configuration flake allowed me to take a foothold in the Nix world.

Last but not least, I thank [@NobbZ](https://github.com/NobbZ) and
[@tejing1](https://github.com/tejing1) for their endless patience, critique and
willingness to show around the Nix ecosystem when I needed it the most. Many
pitfalls were avoided with their help, and many steps were taken forward with
their assistance.

### Awesome People

I got inspired by, and owe a lot to those folks

[sioodmy](https://github.com/sioodmy) - [fufexan](https://github.com/fufexan) -

## Cool Resources

Resource that helped shape and improve this configuration, or resources that I
strongly recommend that you read in no particular order. Note that reading _any_
of those resources would be preferable to going through my config to learn.

### Official Manuals

As silly as manuals split over three different pages may sound, I encourage
everyone (including experts) to read those for comprehensive notes on
**packaging**, **program specific quirks & overrides** and other "pro-tips" on
Nix, Nixpkgs and NixOS.

You are invited to read about the module system in the NixOS manual before you
look into your own NixOS configuration.

[^1]:
    I speak of "over-engineering" not as a flaw, but as a trait that can properly
    describe the time and effort that this repository has taken. After 700+ recorded
    hours and 4500+ commits, that is the only word that can describe this project.
