# The Future of Linux Syndrome

_This is not a tutorial, nor my notes on any Nix/NixOS related process. If you are here
for a Nix shill, you may want to leave now. You will not find it here._

You were not here for a tutorial or me shilling Nix? Great! You are instead in for a short rant about how content creation works! Enjoy.

## Preface

Every so often, I find myself looking at a particular type of post title while I'm checking my RSS feed/Twitter feed and such. "What is x and is it the future of Linux?"
At this point, I am used to this kind of posts. They seem to be a great source of revenue as it's almost a legitimate clickbait, and they will continue to pop up as entrypoints for debates about whatever is trending on the internet. My problem with this, however, is that they set certain unnecessary expectations about the project in question.

## The Problem

When you are referring to something as "the future of Linux", it brings to a person's mind a project that will completely replace their current workflow. Such as Wayland to X11. As much as I want Wayland to completely replace X11 (because let's be honest, X11 is a terribly outdated protocol full of unnecessary hacks at this spoint) calling it hthe future of Linux _right now_ is incorrect. Wayland is still not entirely ready for daily use. So many applications still target X11 and any user that tries out Wayland will face issues, at one point or another.

If a blogpost, a hackernews post, or a Youtube video was to go out and call Wayland the future of Linux (in fact they have), the reception would be negative by some precisely because of those issues. The user is disappointed when the project dubbed "The future of Linux" is still far away from daily-driveable for them.
